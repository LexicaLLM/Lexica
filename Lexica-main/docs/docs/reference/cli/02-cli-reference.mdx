This reference provides detailed information about the Agenta Command Line Interface (CLI), including commands, options, and usage.

## `agenta init`

Initializes a new Agenta project.

### Synopsis

```bash
agenta init [OPTIONS]
```

### Description

The `agenta init` command initializes a new Agenta project. It prompts the user for the application name and allows selection of the Agenta platform host (local, cloud, or remote). This command creates a blank project in the backend and generates a `project.toml` configuration file in the current directory.

### Options

- `--app-name NAME`  
  Specifies the application name directly, bypassing the prompt.

- `--backend-host URL`  
  Specifies the Agenta backend host URL.

- `--help`  
  Displays help information for the command.

### Behavior

- Creates a `project.toml` file containing project configuration.
- If options are not provided, prompts the user for necessary information.

### Prompts

1. **Project Name**

   ```
   ? Please enter the app name:
   ```

2. **Agenta Host Selection**

   ```
   ? Where are you running Agenta? (Use arrow keys)
     â–¸ On Agenta Cloud
       On my local machine
       On a remote machine
   ```

   Depending on the selection:

   - **On Agenta Cloud**: Prompts for API key (retrievable from [Agenta Cloud Settings](https://cloud.agenta.ai/settings?tab=apiKeys)).
   - **On a remote machine**: Prompts for the remote machine URL.

### Example

Initialize a new app named `test-app` for Agenta Cloud:

```bash
agenta init --app-name test-app --backend-host https://cloud.agenta.ai/
```

## `agenta variant list`

Lists all variants of an application.

### Synopsis

```bash
agenta variant list
```

### Description

Displays all the variants associated with your application currently available in the backend.

### Requirements

- Must be executed in a directory containing the `project.toml` file generated by `agenta init`.

### Behavior

- Reads project configuration from `project.toml`.
- Retrieves and lists all variants for the application.

### Example

List all variants:

```bash
agenta variant list
```

---

## `agenta variant remove`

Removes a variant from an application.

### Synopsis

```bash
agenta variant remove
```

### Description

Removes a specified variant from your application or project. The command lists all existing variants and prompts you to select one for removal.

### Requirements

- Must be executed in a directory containing the `project.toml` file generated by `agenta init`.

### Behavior

- Lists all variants associated with the application.
- Prompts the user to select a variant to remove.
- Deletes the selected variant from the backend.

### Example

Remove a variant:

```bash
agenta variant remove
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to select the variant to remove.

---

## `agenta variant serve`

Deploys an application variant to the Agenta platform.

### Synopsis

```bash
agenta variant serve [OPTIONS] FILE_NAME
```

### Description

The `agenta variant serve` command packages and deploys your application code to the Agenta platform. It processes the specified Python file along with any additional files in the same directory. Once deployed, the variant becomes accessible in the web UI and can be further deployed to staging or production environments as an API endpoint.

### Options

- `--file_name FILE_NAME`  
  Specifies the Python file containing the variant code.

- `--overwrite`  
  Overwrites the existing variant if it already exists.

- `--help`  
  Displays help information for the command.

### Requirements

- Must be executed in a directory containing the `project.toml` file generated by `agenta init`.

### Behavior

- Builds a Docker image from the specified Python file.
- Deploys the variant to the Agenta backend.
- The variant is initially named `app_name.default`, where `app_name` is derived from the Python file name.
- Additional configurations can create new variants named `app_name.someconfig`.

### Examples

Deploy a variant from `myapp.py`:

```bash
agenta variant serve myapp.py
```

Overwrite an existing variant:

```bash
agenta variant serve --file_name myapp.py --overwrite
```
