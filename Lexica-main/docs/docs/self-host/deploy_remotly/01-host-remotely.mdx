This guide explains how to deploy Agenta on a remote server, such as a cloud instance or dedicated machine.

## Prerequisites

- A remote server with:
  - Docker installed
  - Docker Compose installed
  - Root access or sudo privileges
  - Open ports for HTTP traffic (default: 80)
- Git installed

## Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Set up three essential environment variables:

```bash
# Replace 'your-domain.com' with your server's domain or IP address
export DOMAIN_NAME="http://your-domain.com"    # Full URL including protocol
export BARE_DOMAIN_NAME="your-domain.com"      # Domain/IP without protocol
export AGENTA_PORT="80"                        # Port for the Agenta service
```

Note: If using an IP address instead of a domain, use the same format:
```bash
export DOMAIN_NAME="http://192.168.1.100"
export BARE_DOMAIN_NAME="192.168.1.100"
```

## Step 2: Clone Agenta Repository

Clone the Agenta repository and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenta-ai/agenta
cd agenta
```

## Step 3: Build and Deploy

Deploy Agenta in two steps:

1. Build only the web interface with your environment configuration:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.gh.yml build --no-cache agenta-web
```

:::info
Note: We only need to rebuild the web image because the domain name is hardcoded at build time in Next.js. Other services can use the pre-built images from Docker Hub.
:::

2. Start all services:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.gh.yml up -d
```

## Verify Your Deployment

After deployment, verify that Agenta is running:

1. Check container status:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

2. Access the web interface by opening your domain/IP in a browser:
```
http://your-domain.com
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check container logs:
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly:
3. Ensure ports are open and accessible:

## Important Notes

- Use HTTP instead of HTTPS for initial setup
- Ensure your firewall allows traffic on the specified port
- For production deployments, consider setting up HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates (docker-compose files with tutorials are planned. Write us in the Slack channel if you are working on this and we might be able to help)
